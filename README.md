## üöÄ The Project

**LAIVE** is an interactive experience where art and technology merge. Using artificial intelligence, the audience's words and emotions are transformed in real-time into unique audiovisual compositions. This project explores new frontiers of artistic expression, creating a bridge between humans and machines.

### How It Works

Interaction is simple and direct. The audience can provide input through:
* **Voice:** Speaking into a microphone.
* **Text:** Writing phrases or ideas.
* **Smartphone:** Interacting via a dedicated web interface.

The AI interprets these inputs and instantly generates:
* **Music:** Composing melodies that reflect the desired mood.
* **Visuals:** Creating dynamic images and videos.
* **Lighting:** Orchestrating a synchronized light show.

The result is a multi-sensory journey where every performance is unique and unrepeatable.

## üé¨ Showcase Video

The "Welcome To The Machine" video introduces the vision and potential of LAIVE. It showcases how a simple text prompt can bring a complex audiovisual creation to life, demonstrating the system's ability to interpret abstract concepts and turn them into art.
